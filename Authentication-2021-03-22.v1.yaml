If the card is a Visa or Mastercard a liability shift is achieved and the recommendation is execute the care authorization. However there us no liabilty shift at this stage for Amex,so the recommendation is not for go for card authorization. * `CHALLENGE_REQUIRED` - The authentication mechanism is available and the next step is to facilitate authentication of the payer. No liabilty shift at this stage. * `SUCCESS_AUTHENTICATED` - The authentication of the payer has been a success and a liabilty shift has been achieved so the recommendation is to go for authorization * `SUCCESS_ATTEMPT_MADE` - A valid attempt to authenticate the payer has been executed and a liabilty shift has been achieved so the recommendation is to go for authorization. * `NOT_AUTHENTICATED` - The payer did not authenticate therefore a liabilty shift has not been achieved. The recommendation is to not proceed with card authorization. * `FAILED` - A step in the authentication process has errored and there do not go for card authorization. * `CHALLENGE_PREFERENCE_ACKNOWLEDGED_INFORMATIONAL_ONLY`'
